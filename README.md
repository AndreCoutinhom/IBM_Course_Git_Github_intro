# 🐙 Git and Github Basics 

> LIDDER, Upkar; AHUJA, Rav. Git and GitHub Basics. IBM Skills Network. 2023.

Collaboration and social coding are crucial parts of contemporary Software Engineering practices and the DevOps culture.  

You will explore key Git concepts such as branching and repositories, as well as the use of Git commands. You will also learn and practice various Git concepts such as forking, cloning and merging workflows. You will learn to use GitHub to work effectively as a team, and perform common Git operations, such as Pull Requests, from both the Web UI and command line.

Developed and taught by experienced IBM practitioners, in this course you’ll gain vital skills and hands-on experience using Git and GitHub. Each module contains hands-on labs for you to apply and practice what you learn.  The course wraps up with a final project where you will start building your portfolio by creating and sharing a public/open-source GitHub project.

## Introduction


Application developers rarely work alone. Large web/cloud/mobile development and data science projects will include many people – front-end developers, back-end developers, database administrators, repository administrators, and others. Every change by every contributor must be tracked and controlled to enable collaboration, accountability and version management. This type of distributed version control is extremely important when managing both small and large software projects. In this module you will learn about some of the popular version control tools,  create a GitHub account and use the GitHub web interface to create a repository, add a file to it and commit your changes.

**Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) have become critical tools in software development**, and key enablers for **social and collaborative coding**. They are not only being used by Software Engineers and DevOps professionals but also by many other technology practitioners such as Data Scientists and Data Engineers.

However their usage is not limited to coding professions only. They are useful anywhere tracking changes/versions and/or collaboration between multiple users is required. At IBM Skills Network, the course instructors and authors use Git repositories extensively even for developing course content such as lab instructions. You will also find usecases in technical documentation, legal document management, and even collaborative development of recipes, books, etc.

While there are many distributed versioning systems,  Git is amongst the most popular ones. And **GitHub is a highly popular Git-based hosted version control platform**, and is seeing incredible growth.  When some of the videos for this course were developed couple of years earlier, there were over 100 million GitHub repositories, whereas at the time of writing, January 2022, they have grown to over 200 million repositories. These include both public and private repositories for both open source and closed source projects.

The popularity of **Git and GitHub** make their use **an essential skill for coding-related professionals** like Software Engineers, Application Developers, Mobile Developers, DevOps & Site Reliability Engineers,  Data Scientists, and Data Engineers. When you try to get a software-related job or switch to a different one,  employers expect you to provide links to your GitHub profile on your resume.

In this course you will **develop the essential conceptual and hands-on skills to work with Git and GitHub**. We will start with an overview of Git and GitHub, followed by **creation of a GitHub account and a project repository**, adding files to it, and committing your changes using the web interface.

Next, you will become familiar with **Git workflows involving branches and pull requests (PRs) and merges**. You will learn to **fork and clone** public repositories, use **pull and push** to synchronize your codebase between local and remote repositories, and **practice working with Git commands** for use in collaborative development workflows. You will also **complete a project** at the end to apply and demonstrate your newly acquired skills.
